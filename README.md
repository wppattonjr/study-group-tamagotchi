## Introduction
This project is based on the popular Tamagotchi game from the 90's. There are four quadrants that allow you to click a button to had to your pet tamagotchi's overall score. Each button either increases or decreases your pet's score with a maximum score of 100.

This project will be built with modules that are laced together with webpack. Set up webpack, eslint, and babel like we have done in class.


## How To Use
